Artwork commission system with escrow, multiple funders/artists, and content unlock on payment

## Commissioning a Work of Art

This provides a legal contract and assurance to one or more artists that funding has been set aside for a work and will be disbursed upon final delivery.

To start the process, an individual uses the GIF Economy website to create a commission by specifying the following:

* A description of the work of art to be produced
* The artists and what their roles are (wallet addresses)
* The start and maximum end date of the work.
* The minimum fee, and the percentage to be distributed to each artist.

## Modifying commission

Before the minimum funding has been met, artists or originators of the commission may make entries in the contract (application calls) modifying the proposed description and terms.

## Multiple Sponsors / "Voting" with Your Wallet

After the commission has been created on the Algorand blockchain as an AVM 1.0 application, it is also listed on the GIF Economy website.
Anyone interested in funding the work or collaboration may then send money to that application (AVM 1 applications are also escrow accounts).

## Multiple Artists

Once the minimum fee has been met and the funding and other items are acceptable to the artists, each artist uses the GIF Economy website to send an application call accepting the commission.

## Acceptance

When all of the artists have sent application calls accepting the commission, the work starting is noted in the application.

## Release of Funds / Return of Funds

The artist(s) may release preview versions of the work and otherwise communicate to complete it.  The artists then upload the final asset to the GIF Economy website where it is stored privately. When they are finished, the Originator has an opportunity to accept the artwork. He/she may also reject it.

If it is rejected, all funds are returned to sponsors. If accepted, the funds are distributed to the artists according to the predetermined percentages, and an asset is minted linking to the unlockable artwork on The GIF Economy website.

## Automatic Unlock of content

The asset URL is a link to a GIF Economy unlockable which before delivering the content,
requires signature verification to ensure the viewer owns the content. This can automatically make
a predetermined set of content available to sponsors once the contract has been recorded as complete. For security purposes, links to content can be given an expiration, or require unlocking each time they are accessed.
